Continuing our post on [My First React Native app](https://cobuildlab.com/development-blog/my-first-ios-and-android-application-using-react-native/), today we will briefly explain how to connect your react native application to the Firebase platform, to quickly start working on your mobile app project.

## Firebase

Firebase is a web and mobile application development platform for building apps faster without managing infrastructure.

Services:

- NoSQL Database
- Machine Learning Kit
- Cloud Functions
- Authentication framework
- Hosting 
- Cloud Storage
- Notifications
- Analytics

## React Native

React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI using declarative components.

## Connecting my React Native Application with Firebase

### 2. Install React Native CLI tool

```bash
npm i -g react-native-cli

### 3. Create a new application with the CLI

- [IOS](https://rnfirebase.io/docs/v5.x.x/installation/ios)

NOTE: For Android Package Name in Firebase, use the name of your app, in this example case is: `com.firebasern`
NOTE: Make sure you keep your `google-services.json` at hand because it is required further on the config steps

### 9. Open the Android Studio in the `android` folder of the project

### 10. Open or create an AVD (Emulator)
