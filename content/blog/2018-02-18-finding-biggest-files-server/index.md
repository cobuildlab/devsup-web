Every 5 weeks more or less our Jenkins server stop working. This is for disk space consumption, some how we can&#8217;t figure out how to prevent the machine to cache docker images.

Today, i erase as usual every image and container, but still have a lot space used.

So i did a little research and find out &#8220;[df](https://linux.die.net/man/1/df)&#8221; and &#8220;[du](https://linux.die.net/man/1/du)&#8221; command:

For visualization partition info in a human readable way just type:

<pre class="prettyprint">df -h</pre>

and for findig where are the large files use:

<pre class="prettyprint">du -a &lt;FOLDER-TO_LOOK&gt; | sort -n -r | head -n 10</pre>
