> These are a set of commonalities and practices learn from my experience with Java, Python and Javascript development over near 20 years of experience. Angel Lacret
    
This set of practices are heavily based on these books:

This document aims to reduce the friction between patterns, conventions and best practices to right `effective code`. (See below)

### **Effective code:**

- Easy to understand
- Well organized
- Self descriptive
- Well documented
- Easily Testable
- Easily Debuggable
- Named under a clear pattern
- Robust: enhancements don't create undesired side effects
- Portable: easy to reuse
- Predictable
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) compliant

### as the contrast of **Ineffective Code:**

- Difficult to understand and read
- Difficult to test
- Difficult to debug: Given a fail scenario is not clear to the eye where the error is being generated
- Does more than 1 thing


# **1. General Best Practices for Code Style.**

<br/>

## **1.1 Don't use more than one sentence in a try/catch block**

Is a common mistake for new developers to surround long function calls or views inside try-catch blocks as a failsafe or catch all exception handling. But in fact, this is one sign of ineffective code.

Multi sentence try catch blocks are **ineffective** because:

- Difficult to debug, as is not 100% clear which sentences are generating an exception.
- Promote a bad pattern of handling all exceptions in the same way
- Usually this broad catch blocks make use of a generic and catch all object or class that does not prepare your code for unknown / undesired scenarios, and promotes the handling of all the exceptions in the same way. 

Keep your code predictable, robust, solid and **effective** by:

- For readability and robustness keep your try/catch blocks limited to 1 sentence
- Use specific Exceptions subclasses and not broads classes or definitions to prevent unknown scenarios to behave like know scenarios
- For easier bug hunting, make sure to handle different Exceptional scenarios appropriately  


<br/>
## **1.2 Prefer the use of `constants` over `variables`.**

Prefer the use of `constants` over `variables` for holding values always that is possible.

- The use of constants reduces the occurrences of bugs by reducing the origins of errors like: assignments, loops, contexts, etc.
- Code readability, constants values by definition cannot change, making the code easier to read and to debug.
- Efficiency: Many Runtimes promise faster access to constant values than to variables values.


<br/>

## **1.3 Prefer use the **Return Early** pattern instead of complex conditionals or nested blocks** 

Enforce the **Return Early** pattern in functions and methods.

- Return early pattern forces you to first consider exceptional situations or error conditions in your functions like validations and variables or input inconsistencies on the first lines of a function or method.
- Reduce Visual Noise
- Reduce complexity of conditionals
- Increase readability by excluding error and edge conditions early on the code and letting focusing on the complex part of the function


*PREFER THIS:*

```python
def is_valid_string (text, allow_empty = false):
	if text === None: 
		return False
	if text === '' and allow_empty == False: 
		return False
	return True
);
```

```javascript
const isDivisibleBy = (value, divisor) => (
	if(value === 0) 
		return true;
	if(divisor === 0) 
		return false;
	if(value === divisor) 
		return true;
	return value % divisor === 0;
);

const TableView = ({children, loading}) => {
	if(loading)
		return <Loading size={10} />;

	//... logic
	return (
	    <div className='inline-block'>
	        <h1 className='header-note'>
	            {children}
	            <span class='icon-header-note'>
	                <img src={icon} />
	            </span> 
	        </h1>
	    </div>
	);
}
```

*AND NOT THIS:*

```python
def is_valid_string (text, allow_empty = false):
	if text !== None :
        #
        #
            if ...
                #
                #
                #
                return True
    else:
	    return False
);

```

```javascript
const isValidString = (text, allowEmpty = false) => (
	if(text !== null){
		if(text !== undefined){
			if(allowEmpty === false){
				if (text === ''){
					return false;
				}else{
					return true
				}					
			}
			else...
		}
	}else{
		return false;
	}
);

const TableView = ({children, loading}) => {
	//	... logic
	return (
		{loading ? <Loading size={10}> :
	    <div className='inline-block'>
	        <h1 className='header-note'>
	            {children}
	            <span class='icon-header-note'>
	                <img src={icon} />
	            </span> 
	        </h1>
	    </div>}
	);
}
```

## 1.4 Manage errors and exceptional situations with Exceptions 

 
- Meaningful values like false or null or None or void do not represent properly an error scenario.
- Raising exceptions allows you to be consistent with the result type of the function.
- Allows the user of the function what to do on each scenario.
- Avoids confusion comparing return values.
